# Secured-Voting-System

### Overview
This project introduces an online voting system in which the election data is stored and processed.
To achieve higher level of security, two levels of authentication techniques are used.
First authentication technique used is a Face Detection and Recognition system.
In this method of authentication, the voterâ€™s face image captured during the registration is compared with the image captured by the webcam at the time of casting vote. Second level authentication is done using One Time Password (OTP) principle.
After the first level of authentication is done, a pseudo random number is generated using the OTP principle that is used by the voter while casting the vote. These techniques provide a more secure platform thus overcoming vulnerabilities of the traditional voting system.

### Main Highlights
#### Secured Voting using AI (Face Recognition)

### Scope
